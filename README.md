Stage Light Auto
================

Overview
--------
A program to controll dmx lighting in real time based on pixel values in real
time from a windows machine (windows was used as for my purposes it would have
to work on a windows machine and doing this cross platform is a pain)

Current
-------
The program is currently in the very early testing phases and no interesting
code has been written yet.

Future Features
----------------
1. DMX control for lighting
2. networking for remote controll
3. An interface for input of light locations
